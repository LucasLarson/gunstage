What
~~~~
There are at least eight ways to unstage files in a Git&nbsp;repository.
Remembering which versions of Git support which syntax, under which
circumstances, reduced my productivity enough to publish this software
in&nbsp;response.

This is a command-line shell plugin for undoing `git add`. Too many
staged&nbsp;files? Can’t remember if it’s `git reset HEAD` or
`git restore --staged -- `? Just remember&nbsp;`gunstage`.

If you don’t want to unstage everything, more granular control is available and
`gunstage` works exactly as you would expect the opposite of `git add` to work.
You can unstage directories or only
specific&nbsp;files: `gunstage file1.txt file2.txt directory/`.

Why
~~~
There is no `git unstage`&nbsp;command. While `git restore --staged` often
performs the task, it’s not reliable nor is it an obvious formula based on
Git’s other&nbsp;commands.

Instead of keeping up with the latest incarnation of Git, whose `git restore`
`man` page says the “command is experimental” and “the behavior may change”,
in https://git-scm.com/docs/git-restore/2.28.0#_description[all capital
letters^] no less, you can let this script do the remembering for&nbsp;you.

Minutiæ of the pedantic and querulous variety
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To unstage content in a Git repository&nbsp;– that is, to undo a
`git add`&nbsp;– you must remember https://stackoverflow.com/q/58003030[which
commands^] are still in use out of the many I’m aware of having been
recommended so&nbsp;far:

1. `git restore --staged` (https://stackoverflow.com/a/16044987[source^]),
1. `git reset HEAD` (https://stackoverflow.com/a/6790291[source^]),
1. `git reset` (https://stackoverflow.com/a/6790285[source^]),
1. `git restore --staged --` (https://github.com/iain/dotfiles/commit/4c8f8cf7b849d723cbd0e029457dd24c42ea6263[source^]),
1. `git reset HEAD --` (https://stackoverflow.com/a/5798967[source^]),
1. `git rm --cached` (https://stackoverflow.com/a/5798967[source^]),
1. `git reset --` (https://stackoverflow.com/a/6919257[source^]), and&nbsp;even
1. `git rm --cached -- # ffs` (https://stackoverflow.com/a/30231316[source^]).

Next, you must be aware of repository&nbsp;context: if the repository is new
and no commit has occurred yet, then `git restore --staged` won’t&nbsp;work,
but `gunstage`&nbsp;will.

gunstage # 🔫 git unstage as a service
-----------------
Its name is an abbreviation and portmanteau&nbsp;– or
portmantabbreviation&nbsp;–, of `git unstage` arising by analog from
https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/c99f3c50fa46a93be28be88632889404fff3b958/plugins/git/README.md#aliases[Oh&nbsp;My&nbsp;Zsh’s
other `git`&nbsp;aliases^].

How
~~~
I developed this script in Zsh, for Zsh. But `gunstage` ports perfectly to the
Korn shell as well as to&nbsp;Bash. You can literally just change `env`’s
argument on
https://github.com/LucasLarson/gunstage/blob/main/gunstage.plugin.zsh#L1[line&nbsp;1^].

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/tree/zsh-5.8[Zsh&nbsp;5.8^] (or
  https://github.com/att/ast/tree/ksh93u[Ksh&nbsp;93^] (or
  https://git.sv.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/commit/?h=bash-5.0[Bash&nbsp;5.0^])),
  and
* https://github.com/git/git/tree/v2.17.0[Git&nbsp;2.17^].

Testing
~~~~~~~
I tested `gunstage` atop Zsh&nbsp;5.8 using&nbsp;Git:

* 2.17 on Ubuntu&nbsp;18.04,
* 2.20 on Debian&nbsp;9.12,
* 2.28 on macOS&nbsp;11.0 and Alpine&nbsp;3.11 and&nbsp;3.12, and
* 2.29 on macOS&nbsp;11.0 and Alpine&nbsp;3.11 and&nbsp;3.12.

From macOS, I use https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2[iTerm2^]; from iOS, I use
https://github.com/ish-app/ish[iSH^].
